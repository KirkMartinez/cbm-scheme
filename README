Herein ye shall find a Scheme interpreter for the Commodore 128.

You will need the following items:
  1. The VICE emulator (to generate .d64 disk image)
	http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net
  2. The cc65 C compiler, assembler, linker
	http://cc65.github.io/cc65/
  3. (Optional) A Commodore 128 (or you can use VICE)
	http://www.ebay.com

You can probably use other platforms supported by cc65.
Just change the SYS target platform in the Makefile.

To build the Scheme interpreter:
	make 

The create a disk image (scheme.d64): 
	make disk

The Scheme implementation is based on Peter Michaux's Scheme from 
Scratch article: 
http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction

I made some changes to the Scheme syntax to suit the CBM:
  - Character literals are expressed using #% instead of #\
  - You can quote double-quotes in a string using percent (%", not \")
  - Use #%newline and #%space for newline and space in strings
  - Symbols can only be up to 10 characters long

Enjoy!
